This is a short document to illustrate the basic use of \LaTeX.

Simply leave a blank line to get a new paragraph; indentaation is automatic.

Mathematical expressions such as $y = 3 \sin x$ are obtained with dollar signs.
Equations can be displayed, as in
\[
  y = 3 \sin x.
\]
Numbered equations are also possible:
\begin{equation}\label{equa}
  y = 3 \sin x.
\end{equation}
Because we have labeled this equation we can refer to it without having to
know its number. Thus, the preceding equation was number ~(\ref{equa}).
